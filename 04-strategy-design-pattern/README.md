<h2>The Strategy Design Pattern and Polymorphism</h2>
<p>The Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and then makes them interchangeable. And ultimately by leveraging polymorphism
we are able to build loosely coupled applications where we are able to swap in out various components at runtime.</p>

<p><strong>Define a family of algorithms:</strong> This means that an algorithm or task that can be executed in multiple ways or strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulate and make them interchangeable:</strong> The algorithms are allowed to be interchangeable at runtime by making them adhere to a common interface.</p>
